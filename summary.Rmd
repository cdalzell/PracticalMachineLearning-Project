# Practical Machine Learning: Project Writeup
========================================================

Datasets were provided using data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.

Data was downloaded from the following locations:
